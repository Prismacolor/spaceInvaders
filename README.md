Tee's Space Invaders

This project has been built from the YouTube tutorial created by Tech With Tim with
minor adjustments regarding organization, setup, testing, and the addition of a scoring
feature. It was created by myself as a way to build my Python programming skills.

The project consists of a main script, space.py. Simply running this in an IDE (I used
Pycharm) should be enough to launch the game. You will be given one main (yellow) ship
that appears at the bottom of the screen. You can move the ship by using the arrow keys
on your keyboard. Use the space key to fire at enemy ships. You have three lives. If any
enemy makes it to the bottom of the screen without being destroyed, you lose one life. You
can as a last resort destroy enemy ships by flying into them but this will affect your
health (shown as a green bar below your ship.) Being struck by enemy fire will also affect
your health. Each level brings more enemy mayhem! :D

There are three additional folders. The 'assets' folder will contain all the images used in
this game. The 'game_assets' contains the classes and some of the functions for the game. The
'tests' folder will contain the unit tests for the application.

Feel free to add your own modifications with regards to number of enemies, speed of enemies,
and so on. There are also comments throughout the scripts that should help you understand
the reasoning behind some of the code. Pew pew!
